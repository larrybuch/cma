<p>There are about 35 of us. We all come from different places and backgrounds, but at our core we’re all reporters — gathering information and figuring out the best visual form to represent it. There are coders, mappers, illustrators, designers, animators, statisticans, chartmakers and</p>

<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, how about a story like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/sports/worldcup/brazil-first-goal-videos.html">this</a> that shows you a country’s collective reaction.</p>
<p>Or a story <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/27/world/greenland-is-melting-away.html">like this</a> that takes you onto an melting ice sheet.</p>

<h2><a id="Howd_I_get_here_34"></a>How’d I get here?</h2>
<p>I spent way, way, way too much time at my college (and middle and high school) paper doing every job I could — designer, cops beat reporter, visual columnist, editor.</p>
<p>Then I graduated from Indiana University, stayed in Bloomington (college town where I graduated) for a year and freelanced for everyone I could — non-profits, the university, newspapers, magazines, friends of my mom’s who needed logos for their new companies (for real).</p>
<p>Then I moved to New York and freelanced there. In the big city, under the big lights, with tiny, tiny clients.</p>
<p>Then I took a class at a place called <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> to learn how to make things move and change and grow on the internet.</p>
<p>Then I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/tmthyluke/status/295974605758283777">tweet</a> from my friend Luke about graphics at The New Yorker. I emailed, him, faked my way into the place, and never looked back.</p>
<p>I made <a href="http://projects.newyorker.com/story/citi-bike.html">some good stuff</a>, <a href="http://larrybuch.com/newyorker/beer/">some bad stuff</a>, and then <a href="https://twitter.com/Duenes">a guy</a> at The New York Times saw it. And emailed me.</p>
<h2><a id="This_sounds_overwhelming_Can_I_really_learn_all_this_stuff_48"></a>This sounds overwhelming. Can I really learn all this stuff?</h2>
<p>Yes. Take it one step at a time. I know exactly as much javascript as I need to. No more, no less. (Actually, probably a little bit less.) When I need to do something I don’t know how to do, I google it. Google is your friend. Google holds all of the answers. The internet is an incredibly giving place, actually.</p>

<h2><a id="What_do_we_use_to_make_the_things_we_make_And_how_can_you_make_them_55"></a>What do we use to make the things we make? And how can you make them?</h2>
<p>First, HTML/CSS/JavaScript. These are the backbone of the web. And at their core, they’re pretty simple. To borrow an analogy from my friend Adrian, if we think of code like a body, HTML is kind of like the skeleton or the strucutre, CSS would be things like hair color, eye color, skin tone, in otherwords, the style and visible features, and JavaScript is kind of like the muscle, making things move and change and respond.</p>
<p><a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/">GA Dash</a> is a great place to start learning to code.</p>
<p>For static graphics, almost everything goes through <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a>.</p>
<p>To get those graphics online we use a tool called <a href="http://ai2html.org/">ai2html</a> that takes Illustrator graphics and turns them into HTML (and also helps to make different versions for desktop, tablet and mobile).</p>
<p>A few other great free charting tools you could use.</p>
<p><a href="http://raw.densitydesign.org/">Raw</a>, which has a bunch of weird, non-standard charts.</p>
<p><a href="http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/">Quartz chart builder</a> which is totally open source, so you can tweak to your liking.</p>
<p>To handle data and make rough charts, we use Excel and <a href="http://drive.google.com/">Google Docs</a>. Great for collaboration and sharing.</p>
<p>And, for the more ambitious, a program called <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.</p>
<p>And to make those charts interactive, we use an open-source javascript library called <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>;</p>
<p>For mapping, there’s a great free program called <a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>. It’s incredibly powerful and could be used to make most of the maps you see on the Times site.</p>
<p>For interactive maps <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox and TileMill</a> are great.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a> and <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a> are fantastic places to get map data.</p>
<p>For 3D graphics, we mainly use <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview">Maya</a>.</p>
<p>For animation we use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html">AfterEffects</a>;</p>
